    {id: 1, name: "Lord Vasraan", bio: "The great Lord Vasraan is all you could want in a ruling Lord. Ruthless, but fair. Powerful, but just. Under his great rulership this sector can only and will only prosper! The great Lord Vasraan was able to not only take Zula IV from the rebels, but also rally a fleet powerful enough to defeat the Republic in the region and conquer a further eight systems for the Empire, carving out his own fifedom in what is now known as the Zula IV Region. \n\nFollowing this success, he was able to begin constructing his own powerbase, recruiting Lords, Sith and Acolytes to his service whilst increase the number of military assets at his command. With this new powerbase at his disposal, he then launched a campaign against the Republic in the Tryst systems, scoring a number of victories including a significant naval victory at Pancha. \n\nSuch a Lord can only mean great things for the future of our citizens!", quote: "Back in my day these rebels would not have lasted a week, nay, a day!", imgsrc: "/assets/images/Vasraan.jpg"},
    {id: 2, name: "Lord Executor Val'haar", bio: "The iron first of the the systems! Lord Executor Val’haar is the man you want when the going gets tough and the tough get going. \n\nLord Val'haar was the only Acolyte to survive the Trials from his group. There are no records of what took place during that period, what a spooky backstory to have! The Lord Val'haar has taken part in many frontline battles, sieges, assaults and infiltration operations after the peace treaty between the Empire and the Republic collapsed. He obtained the status of Lord after more than a decade of servitude, acquiring all of the assets of his Master, after Lord Reigal's abrupt passing. \n\nSo Lord Val’haar as the capability, the strength and the resources to be the man to keep the systems in line! With him, you just know that any forces seeking to bring harm to our citizens will be crushed under his iron fist!", quote: "They [the rebels] are a plague that will be cleansed by the might of the Empire", imgsrc: "/assets/images/Val2.png"},
    {id: 3, name: "Lord Arcanus Y'vass", bio: "The beautiful Lord Arcanus Y’vass herself, who else do you want as the right hand of the ruling Lord of our systems? Her capability with the force is only match by her capability with the brain! What a source of knowledge she is. With her, not only do the systems have the strength to be protected, but the wisdom to be guided to prosperity also! \n\nThe youngest daughter of the second wife of a Pureblood noble, Y’vass was brought up secure in the knowledge that she was Force Sensitive, entitled to a life of nobility and bound for greatness. \n\nOur Lord Arcanus survived ruin in her young life, and from those ruinous ashes rose a powerful Sith who is adaptable and won’t let anything stand in her way! Including any issues facing our beloved citizens!", quote: "[The rebels are] Pathetic", imgsrc: "/assets/images/Yvass.jpg"},
    {id: 4, name: "Lord Shadowhand Dauphine", bio: "The Lord Shadowhand herself. Don’t let the title fool you, she is not just stealthy and intelligent, moving unseen like the shadows themselves… she is also a mighty and powerful warrior! Some may say the most physically strong being in the powerbase! \n\nShe has also proven herself a dogged and stubborn Lord, these qualities leading her to where she is now in fact! She guides the powerbase in so many ways and as such my citizens, you can be assured that she will be guiding you all as well! Guiding you to victory and prosperity!", quote: "I could pick up these rebels up with one hand and shake the until they are obedient!", imgsrc: "/assets/images/Dauphine.jpg"},
    {id: 5, name: "Lord Overseer Itharias", bio: "The Lord Overseer is a very wise and experienced member of the powerbase. His long life has allowed him to bring to our systems a valuable font of knowledge and experience to draw from. Whatever situation you think you’ve faced? The Lord Overseer has also faced it, and in even more extreme conditions! \n\nHis very coming into being as Lord was forged in war and battle! When he took the opportunity to rally surviving Imperial forces and fellow Sith into a defensive position during a battle with Zakuul, he emerged from the ensuing chaos a Lord of the sith! \n\nHe is no stranger to pain and hardship so you can be assured that he will be there whenever hardship occurs to our citizens, and he will ensure you are protected and made strong enough to handle whatever is thrown at you!", quote: "I shall teach these rebels the errors of their ways, and they have many errors!", imgsrc: "/assets/images/Itharias.png"},
    {id: 6, name: "Lord Rhozan", bio: "Our alchemical genius Lord! When he’s not creating new ways of melting down his enemies or prolonging his own life, you can bet he’s brewing up new ways to improve the lives of our citizens! \n\nHis lust for lost and secret knowledge drives him ever further. This Lord has the mind of a researcher, so if you citizens were ever thinking, ‘I’m so happy we have so many powerful warriors protecting us, but I hope one of those powerful beings is also thinking about scientific endeavours’, then look no further! Lord Rhozan also on the cusp of progress and he will deliver a bright and glorious future for our systems!", quote: "My comment on the rebellions? As far as I'm concerned, it isn't rebellion, it's treason. The citizens of these various planets have accepted the Empire. It is a minority who see fit to take hostages, destroy necessary infrastructure for their fellow citizens and landmarks in an attempt to secure any sort of meaningful purpose in their lives. These are disorganised criminals, riotous and uncouth", imgsrc: "/assets/images/Rhozan.jpg"},
    {id: 7, name: "Lord Nar'ressa", bio: "The bullish, blunt yet powerful Lord Nar’ressa is a new addition to our systems, oh but what a worthy addition she is! Lord Nar'ressa has established a prosperous and respectable powerbase upon several planets in the Outer Rim. Each of which was involved in either the extracting, refining or trading of goods for the Empire. In her previous life, Lord Nar'ressa held both the position of Archivist and Supreme Prosecutor simultaneously. Positions she would retain until her departure from the powerbase during the Sulnea campaign. \n\nTherefore what a fortunate circumstance it was that such a strong, yet responsible Lord has come to join the ranks in safeguarding our citizens in our systems! You are all in capable hands here!", quote: "The rebellion is, quite plainly, a desperate action by desperate people. Something easily quelled and swept aside if not mis-managed. While it might be considered a noble act by some, fundamentally it is a tribal and chaotic course of action to take; while now full of promise, tenacity and fury it will ultimately achieve nothing", imgsrc: "/assets/images/Naressa.jpg"},
    {id: 8, name: "Lord Xachena", bio: "Another new but worthy addition to the ranks of our Lords! The Lord Xa’Chena is a firey and impressive individual, a figure of martial perfection! She is almost a weapon in human form as she has been forged through the trials and terrors of her upbringing, dragging herself through them with sheer grit against the adversity. \n\nHardly the prodigious heir that her parents had wished for, the woman instead crawled her way through the academy. Proving herself worthy by the skin of her teeth as more than a meek Acolyte. \n\nLord Orrien’s ascension was all but guaranteed, having proven herself to her order, she emerged as a cold, conflict driven individual. Ready to lay waste to the enemies of the Empire.  And lucky for you our beloved citizens, her enemies are your enemies!", quote: "These rebels shall be crushed beneath my powerful and muscular physique!", imgsrc: "/assets/images/xachena.png"},
    {id: 9, name: "Lord Maldrec", bio: "Lord Maldrec's past is most certainly one to be considered unremarkable. He was born into a poor Arkanian Offshoot family on one of the mining worlds where he spent his youth with his family. At some point during his youth it became apparent that he was indeed force sensitive. \n\nLord Maldrec may come from humble beginnings but don’t let that make you underestimate him! Beneath his incredibly cool and calm exterior lies a powerful and cunning Lord who knows exactly how to get what he wants! Unlike many of our Lords he leads himself through logic and knows how to calculate his way to victory. He provides a good balance in the minds of the Lords and our systems citizens will be better protected and will certainly prosper under his cold and logical mind!", quote: "The actions of these rebels are... illogical", imgsrc: "/assets/images/Maldrec.jpg"},
    {id: 10, name: "Lord Esmee Koln", bio: "Behold our wildcat Lord! I feel sorry for any enemies that she makes as they will be torn to shreds by both her and her ferocious pet! But this is good news for you citizens as both our Lord and her faithful guardian are set to ensure the safety of our systems! \n\nShe is certainly one of our more driven lords, her passion has driven her to many incredibly risky decisions, the Lord seeking powers that only she has the courage to face, a favorable outcome out of it seeming so far out of reach, but nothing will stop her until she sees what she desires done! It is good that one of her desires is the safekeeping of our citizens!", quote: "Tear, rip, sunder! My animals will devour the rebels!", imgsrc: "/assets/images/Esmerelly.png"},
    {id: 11, name: "Lord Kracaen", bio: "This Lord is an agent of chaos, you never know what he will do! However, in these chaotic times it is always good to have chaos on your side! And he is certainly on your side citizens! \n\nAs a Lord from the age of 30, he has an extensive military record through the renewed Galactic War, up until the emergence of the Eternal Empire. So you know you are all in safe hands if an invading force ever threatens you!", quote: "I shall dazzle them all with my mighty mace", imgsrc: "/assets/images/Kracaen.jpg"}
